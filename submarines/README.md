Submarines and battleships
----------

Naval warfare is a complicated undertaking due
to the varying capabilities and vulnerabilities of both
friendly and enemy ships. Deciding who should attack
who is a critical decision that can determine the
outcome of the battle.
Figure 1 shows a map of 15 blue, friendly submarines
and 15 red, enemy battleships. Your goal is to
move each submarine so that it occupies the same
cell as a battleship. When a submarine occupies the
same cell as a battleship, the battleship is destroyed.
Each submarine can only destroy one battleship. Battleships
cannot move.
Use Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance
between cells. For example, the distance between
cells A1 and B3 is 2.236 km.

**QUESTION**: What is the minimum total distance
the submarines need to travel to destroy all of the
battleships?

###Solution
Some kind of minimum-weight perfect matching problem in a bipartite graph. 
Small instance, just build a MIP and solve it.
